                <h2>Bowtruckle</h2>
                <p>A Bowtruckle served as a tree guardian for its home tree. Notably, a Bowtruckle only made its home in tree whose wood was of wand quality (such as a Wiggentree). They never nested in mundane trees. It was generally a peaceful creature, but it would defend its home rather aggressively, attempting to gouge out an attacker's eyes if anything threatened its tree or itself. It was also adept at dodging most types of charms. In order to take leaves or wood from a Bowtruckle's tree, a wizard or witch had to offer it some of its favorite foods; woodlice or fairy eggs, as a distraction.</p>
                <ul class="beast-traits">
                    <li><strong>Magical abilities and skills: </strong> Lock picking. Pickett was named for his uncanny skill for picking locks, unlocking Newt's shackles in the Death Cell,and unlocking the gate in Yusuf Kama's hideout in the sewers.</li>

                <h2>Demiguise</h2>
                <p>
                Demiguise pelts were highly sought after as the hair can be woven into Invisibility Cloaks. Cloaks made from their hair eventually turned opaque, losing their invisibility effects as time passed. Demiguises had precognitive sight, so that the only way to catch them was to do something completely unpredictable. The Demiguise's ability to make itself invisible was used to symbolise the number zero, in the runic alphabet. Tincture of Demiguise could be extracted from Demiguises and used as a potion ingredient.</p>
                <ul class="beast-traits">
                <li><strong>Invisible: </strong> While shifting between visible and invisible, the Demiguise at some points appears translucent, as if blending in with the colours of its surrounding, in a similar manner to the effects of the Disillusionment Charm.</li>

                    <h2>Billywig</h2>
                    <p>The Billywig was a magical insect native to Australia. It was rated XXX, and was around half an inch long and of a vivid sapphire blue colour. The speed of the Billywig may be why it was rarely noticed by Muggles, and wizards and witches often only spotted it once they had been stung. The Billywig's wings were attached to the top of its head and rotated extremely fast, spinning the Billywig so that it could fly. Xenophilius Lovegood used Billywig wings for his recreation of Ravenclaw's Diadem because he believed they "induce an elevated frame of mind".</p>
                    <ul class="beast-traits">
                    <li><strong>Sting: </strong> The Billywig also had a long, thin stinger at the bottom of its body. Anyone stung by a Billywig would suffer giddiness, followed by levitation, which is what gave the Billywig its rating of XXX. </li>

                    <h2>Niffler</h2>
                    <p>
                    The Niffler was a magical beast with a long snout and a coat of black, fluffy fur. They were attracted to shiny things, which made them wonderful for locating treasure, but that also meant that they could wreak havoc if kept (or let loose) indoors. Nifflers in general were usually harmless. Students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry learnt about Nifflers in Care of Magical Creatures class, an elective that could be chosen in the third year of their education.</p>
                    <ul class="beast-traits">
                    <li><strong>Pouch: </strong> Nifflers had a pouch on their bellies which held far more than at first seemed possible, like the effects of an Undetectable Extension Charm on a container.</li>

                <div class="beast-content">
                    <h2>Occamy</h2>
                    <p>It was a plumed, two-legged serpentine-bodied creature with wings that reached up to fifteen feet in height. The Occamy was extremely aggressive to anyone who approached it, and lived off of insects, rats, birds, and occasionally monkeys. It was extremely protective of its eggs, which were made of the most pure and soft silver. It was found in the Far East and India. The Occamy was known to be choranaptyxic, meaning it grew or shrank in order to fit available space. It was a known possible but rare corporeal form of the Patronus Charm.</p>
                    <ul class="beast-traits">
                    <li><strong>Choranaptyxis</strong> Choranaptyxis was a characteristic some magical creatures had of being able to grow or shrink in order to fit available space. </li>

                    <h2>Thunderbird</h2>
                    <p>
                    The Thunderbird was described as having a head that was "similar to that of an eagle"; or, in the wizarding world, "similar to that of a Hippogriff". They possessed three pairs of powerful wings, and had feathers that shimmered with cloud-like patterns. They could create rain storms in their wake as they flew. Notably, if given a potion vial, then the Thunderbird could infuse the potion into the storm, lacing the rain with it. This allowed for the potion to cover a very wide area, affecting everyone under storm. Thunderbirds could also sense danger.</p>
                    <ul class="beast-traits">
                    <li><strong>Wand Cores: </strong> Thunderbird tail feathers could be used as wand cores; this type of wand was difficult to master, but extremely powerful and well suited to transfiguration. They were also able to sense danger, much like the bird itself, and were able to cast curses on their own pre-emptively if they sensed supernatural danger nearby. Thunderbird feathers could also be used as quills, although this was very uncommon.</li>
